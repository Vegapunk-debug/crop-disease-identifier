## 1. Problem Statement

### Problem Title
Crop Disease Identifier from Leaf Images

### Problem Description
Crop diseases cause significant reductions in agricultural productivity and farmer income. While early detection is critical to preventing large-scale damage, farmers currently lack accessible, offline, and real-time diagnostic tools. This project aims to build an on-device, camera-based machine learning system that operates fully offline to identify crop diseases from leaf photographs, estimate severity levels, and provide actionable treatment recommendations directly at the point of need.

### Target Users
Farmers and agricultural workers, particularly those in rural or low-connectivity regions who lack immediate access to expert agricultural consultation or reliable internet.

### Existing Gaps
* **Reliance on Manual Methods:** Farmers currently depend on guesswork, manual inspection, or delayed expert consultation, allowing diseases to spread before intervention.
* **Internet Dependency:** Existing digital diagnostic solutions often require active internet connectivity, rendering them unusable in remote agricultural areas.
* **Lack of Comprehensive Offline Tools:** There is a shortage of tools that combine disease classification, severity estimation, and a locally stored agricultural knowledge base into a single, offline application.
* **Economic Vulnerability:** Delayed diagnoses lead to decreased crop yields, increased input costs for late treatments, and reduced income stability for farmers.

## 6. Dataset Selected

### Dataset Name
PlantVillage Dataset (Tomato, Potato, and Bell Pepper Subset)

### Source
Kaggle: [emmarex/plantdisease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) (Originally curated by the PlantVillage project).

### Data Type
Categorized RGB Images. The dataset contains thousands of images divided into 15 distinct classes, representing both healthy leaves and various disease states (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Bacterial Spot) across three major crops: Tomato, Potato, and Bell Pepper.

### Selection Reason
This dataset is widely recognized as a gold-standard benchmark for training plant disease classification models. It was selected because it provides a large, clean, and expertly labeled collection of high-quality leaf images. Its focus on economically significant crops directly aligns with our goal of assisting farmers with high-impact agricultural challenges. The balanced nature of the classes also prevents the machine learning model from becoming heavily biased toward one specific disease.
