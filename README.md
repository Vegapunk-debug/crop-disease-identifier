## 1. Problem Statement

### Problem Title
Crop Disease Identifier from Leaf Images

### Problem Description
Crop diseases cause significant reductions in agricultural productivity and farmer income. While early detection is critical to preventing large-scale damage, farmers currently lack accessible, offline, and real-time diagnostic tools. This project aims to build an on-device, camera-based machine learning system that operates fully offline to identify crop diseases from leaf photographs, estimate severity levels, and provide actionable treatment recommendations directly at the point of need.

### Target Users
Farmers and agricultural workers, particularly those in rural or low-connectivity regions who lack immediate access to expert agricultural consultation or reliable internet.

### Existing Gaps
* **Reliance on Manual Methods:** Farmers currently depend on guesswork, manual inspection, or delayed expert consultation, allowing diseases to spread before intervention.
* **Internet Dependency:** Existing digital diagnostic solutions often require active internet connectivity, rendering them unusable in remote agricultural areas.
* **Lack of Comprehensive Offline Tools:** There is a shortage of tools that combine disease classification, severity estimation, and a locally stored agricultural knowledge base into a single, offline application.
* **Economic Vulnerability:** Delayed diagnoses lead to decreased crop yields, increased input costs for late treatments, and reduced income stability for farmers.

## 6. Dataset Selected

### Dataset Name
PlantVillage Dataset (Tomato, Potato, and Bell Pepper Subset)

### Source
Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emmarex/plantdisease</a>

### Data Type
Thousands of RGB leaf images categorized into 15 classes. It covers both healthy and diseased leaves (like Early Blight and Bacterial Spot) for three main crops: tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers.

### Selection Reason
We chose this dataset because it's a gold standard for plant disease classification. It gives us a clean, expertly labeled, and balanced set of images for high-impact crops, making it perfect for training a reliable, real-world model to help farmers.
